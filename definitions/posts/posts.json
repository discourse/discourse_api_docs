You can run the wizard as many times as you want, it’s completely safe!</p>\n<h3>Admin Dashboard</h3>\n<p>Exercise your admin superpowers any time via the admin dashboard at</p>\n<p><a href=\"/admin\"><strong>/admin</strong></a></p>\n<p>You can also access it via the “hamburger” <kbd>☰</kbd> menu in the upper right: Admin functions are generally marked with the wrench <img src=\"/images/emoji/twitter/wrench.png?v=5\" title=\":wrench:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wrench:\">  icon, so look for that.</p>\n<h3>Staff</h3>\n<p>Staff members are official representatives of this community. There are two kinds of Staff:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Admins</strong>, who can do anything and configure anything on this site.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Moderators</strong>, who can edit all posts and users, but cannot add categories or change any site settings.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To add additional staff members:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>have them sign up on the site (or <a href=\"/my/invited\">send out an invitation to join via your user page</a>)</li>\n<li>click the admin button <img src=\"/images/emoji/twitter/wrench.png?v=5\" title=\":wrench:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wrench:\"> on their user page</li>\n<li>look for the <kbd>Grant Admin</kbd> and <kbd>Grant Moderator</kbd> buttons there</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Social Logins</h3>\n<p>Users can log in with traditional local username and password accounts. You may want to add:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://meta.discourse.org/t/configuring-google-oauth2-login-for-discourse/15858\">Google logins</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://meta.discourse.org/t/configuring-twitter-login-for-discourse/13395\">Twitter logins</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://meta.discourse.org/t/configuring-facebook-login-for-discourse/13394\">Facebook logins</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://meta.discourse.org/t/configuring-github-login-for-discourse/13745\">GitHub logins</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https://meta.discourse.org/t/official-single-sign-on-for-discourse/13045\">set up single-sign on</a>, or even <a href=\"https://meta.discourse.org/t/login-to-discourse-with-custom-oauth2-provider/14717\">build your own login method</a>.</p>\n<h3>Categories</h3>\n<p>You have three default categories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/category/site-feedback\">Site Feedback</a> – general discussion about the site itself. <a href=\"https://meta.discourse.org/t/5249\">It’s important!</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/category/lounge\">Lounge</a> – a perk for users at trust level 3 and higher</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/category/staff\">Staff</a> – visible only to staff (admins and moderators)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Don’t create too many initial categories</strong>, as you can overwhelm your audience. You can always add more categories, and easily bulk recategorize topics later. It’s better to figure out the organization as you go rather than assuming you’ll get it all right from the beginning.</p>\n<p>To add a category, visit the <a href=\"/categories\">categories page</a>, then click Create Category at the upper right. You can set security per-category so only certain groups of users can see topics in that category.</p>\n<p>Every category has an initial “About this category” topic. This topic will be pinned to the top of the category, and the description you enter will be used in a bunch of places. Be sure to give your new category a good, clear description, so people understand what belongs there!</p>\n<h3>Email Notifications and Email Replies</h3>\n<p>All outgoing email is pre-configured correctly for you, as is reply via email, through the <code>discoursemail.com</code> domain. See <a href=\"http://blog.discourse.org/2016/07/reply-by-email-enabled-for-all-discourse-customers/\">our blog post</a> for details.</p>\n<h3>Pinned Topics and Banners</h3>\n<p>Note that pinning topics works a little differently in Discourse:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Once someone reads to the bottom of a pinned topic, it is automatically unpinned for them specifically. They can change this via the personal pin controls at the bottom of the topic.</li>\n<li>When staff pins a topic, they can pin it globally to all topic lists, or just within its category.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a pin isn’t visible enough, you can also turn one single topic into a <strong>banner</strong>.

      "raw": "Thanks for signing up for a [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org) hosting plan!\n\n![](https://www.discourse.org/images/welcome/welcome-to-discourse-hosting-690x314.jpg)\n\n### Getting Started\n\nIf you haven't already, launch the [setup wizard](/wizard) and go through the steps to configure your site. You can run the wizard as many times as you want, it's completely safe!\n\n### Admin Dashboard\n\nExercise your admin superpowers any time via the admin dashboard at\n\n[**/admin**](/admin)\n\nYou can also access it via the \"hamburger\" <kbd>☰</kbd> menu in the upper right: Admin functions are generally marked with the wrench :wrench:  icon, so look for that.\n\n### Staff\n\nStaff members are official representatives of this community. There are two kinds of Staff:\n\n1. **Admins**, who can do anything and configure anything on this site.\n2. **Moderators**, who can edit all posts and users, but cannot add categories or change any site settings.\n\nTo add additional staff members:\n\n- have them sign up on the site (or [send out an invitation to join via your user page](/my/invited))\n- click the admin button :wrench: on their user page\n- look for the <kbd>Grant Admin</kbd> and <kbd>Grant Moderator</kbd> buttons there\n\n### Social Logins\n\nUsers can log in with traditional local username and password accounts. You may want to add:\n\n- [Google logins](https://meta.discourse.org/t/configuring-google-oauth2-login-for-discourse/15858)\n- [Twitter logins](https://meta.discourse.org/t/configuring-twitter-login-for-discourse/13395)\n- [Facebook logins](https://meta.discourse.org/t/configuring-facebook-login-for-discourse/13394)\n- [GitHub logins](https://meta.discourse.org/t/configuring-github-login-for-discourse/13745)\n\nYou can also [set up single-sign on](https://meta.discourse.org/t/official-single-sign-on-for-discourse/13045), or even [build your own login method](https://meta.discourse.org/t/login-to-discourse-with-custom-oauth2-provider/14717).\n\n### Categories\n\nYou have three default categories:\n\n1. [Site Feedback](/category/site-feedback) – general discussion about the site itself. [It's important!](https://meta.discourse.org/t/5249)\n2. [Lounge](/category/lounge) – a perk for users at trust level 3 and higher\n3. [Staff](/category/staff) – visible only to staff (admins and moderators)\n\n**Don't create too many initial categories**, as you can overwhelm your audience. You can always add more categories, and easily bulk recategorize topics later. It's better to figure out the organization as you go rather than assuming you'll get it all right from the beginning.\n\nTo add a category, visit the [categories page](/categories), then click Create Category at the upper right. You can set security per-category so only certain groups of users can see topics in that category.\n\nEvery category has an initial \"About this category\" topic. This topic will be pinned to the top of the category, and the description you enter will be used in a bunch of places. Be sure to give your new category a good, clear description, so people understand what belongs there!\n\n### Email Notifications and Email Replies\n\nAll outgoing email is pre-configured correctly for you, as is reply via email, through the `discoursemail.com` domain. See [our blog post](http://blog.discourse.org/2016/07/reply-by-email-enabled-for-all-discourse-customers/) for details.\n\n### Pinned Topics and Banners\n\nNote that pinning topics works a little differently in Discourse:\n\n- Once someone reads to the bottom of a pinned topic, it is automatically unpinned for them specifically. They can change this via the personal pin controls at the bottom of the topic.\n- When staff pins a topic, they can pin it globally to all topic lists, or just within its category.\n\nIf a pin isn't visible enough, you can also turn one single topic into a **banner**. The banner topic floats on top of all topics and all primary pages. Users can permanently dismiss this floating banner by clicking the &times; in the upper right corner.\n\nTo make (or remove) a pin or a banner, use the admin wrench at the top right or bottom of the topic.\n\n### New User Sandbox and the Trust System\n\nIf your discussion area is be open to the public, new visitors will arrive that are initially strangers to the community. Discourse has a [trust system](https://meta.discourse.org/t/what-do-user-trust-levels-do/4924/2) where users can, over time, earn the trust of the community and gain abilities to assist in governing their community.\n\nDiscourse is designed to offer safe defaults for public communities, even with no active moderation.\n\n> **0 (new) &rarr; 1 (basic) &rarr; 2 (member) &rarr; 3 (regular) &rarr; 4 (leader)**\n\nAll new users start out in a sandbox with restrictions for everyone's safety. **Trust level 0 (new) users _cannot_** &hellip;\n\n- post more than 2 hyperlinks\n- post any images or file attachments\n- send private messages\n- flag posts or topics\n- have actual links in the \"about me\" field of their profile\n- @name mention more than 2 users in a post\n\nVirtually every action a user can take is rate limited for safety, and especially so for new users. But don't worry, new users can [transition to trust level 1](https://meta.discourse.org/t/what-do-user-trust-levels-do/4924/2) in about 15 minutes.\n\nThese defaults are safe, but note that while in \"bootstrap mode\" after you set up your site, all new users will be granted trust level 1 until you reach 50 users.\n\n### Building Your Community\n\nBe patient; building communities is hard. Before launching, be sure to:\n\n1. Define your community's purpose in a pinned or banner topic.\n2. Seed the discussion with interesting topics.\n3. Commit to visiting and participating regularly.\n4. Link your community everywhere and promote it so people can find it.\n\nThere's more advice at [Building a Discourse Community](http://blog.discourse.org/2014/08/building-a-discourse-community/).\n\n### Sending Invitations\n\nOne way to get people to visit your site is to invite them via email. You can do this via:\n\n- The Invite button at the bottom of the topic.\n- The Invite area on your profile page.\n\nThe invite area on your profile page also includes advanced Staff methods of [sending bulk invites](https://meta.discourse.org/t/sending-bulk-user-invites/16468), and [inviting users into groups](https://meta.discourse.org/t/invite-individual-users-to-a-group/15544).\n\n### Maintenance\n\nSince you're hosted on the official Discourse servers, we'll handle all maintenance, upgrades, and backups. Relax! If you'd like to take a manual backup right from your web browser any time, just visit [/admin/backups](/admin/backups).\n\n### Extras\n\nHere are some other features that you might want to use:\n\n   - Embed Discourse [in your WordPress install](https://github.com/discourse/wp-discourse), or [on your static HTML site](http://eviltrout.com/2014/01/22/embedding-discourse.html)\n\n### Need More Help?\n\n- Contact us directly via email any time at [support@discourse.org](mailto:support@discourse.org).\n\n- For general community assistance, see [meta.discourse.org](http://meta.discourse.org).\n\n----\n\nHave suggestions to improve this guide?

      "raw": "<a name=\"civilized\"></a>\n\n## [This is a Civilized Place for Public Discussion](#civilized)\n\nPlease treat this discussion forum with the same respect you would a public park.  We, too, are a shared community resource &mdash; a place to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing conversation.\n\nThese are not hard and fast rules, merely guidelines to aid the human judgment of our community and keep this a clean and well-lighted place for civilized public discourse.\n\n<a name=\"improve\"></a>\n\n## [Improve the Discussion](#improve)\n\nHelp us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.\n\nThe topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.\n\nOne way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening. Spend time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you’ll have a better chance of meeting others who share your interests.\n\n<a name=\"agreeable\"></a>\n\n## [Be Agreeable, Even When You Disagree](#agreeable)\n\nYou may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That’s fine. But remember to _criticize ideas, not people_. Please avoid:\n\n*   Name-calling\n*   Ad hominem attacks\n*   Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content\n*   Knee-jerk contradiction\n\nInstead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation.\n\n<a name=\"participate\"></a>\n\n## [Your Participation Counts](#participate)\n\nThe conversations we have here set the tone for every new arrival. Help us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an interesting place to be &mdash; and avoiding those that do not.\n\nDiscourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, and so forth. Use these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else’s, too.\n\nLet’s leave our community better than we found it.\n\n<a name=\"flag-problems\"></a>\n\n## [If You See a Problem, Flag It](#flag-problems)\n\nModerators have special authority; they are responsible for this forum. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.\n\nWhen you see bad behavior, don’t reply. It encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. _Just flag it_. If enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.\n\nIn order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts; the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.\n\n<a name=\"be-civil\"></a>\n\n## [Always Be Civil](#be-civil)\n\nNothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:\n\n*   Be civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.\n*   Keep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.\n*   Respect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.\n*   Respect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.\n\nThese are not concrete terms with precise definitions &mdash; avoid even the _appearance_ of any of these things. If you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of the New York Times.\n\nThis is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.\n\n<a name=\"keep-tidy\"></a>\n\n## [Keep It Tidy](#keep-tidy)\n\nMake the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up. So:\n\n*   Don’t start a topic in the wrong category.\n*   Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.\n*   Don’t post no-content replies.\n*   Don’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.\n*   Don’t sign your posts &mdash; every post has your profile information attached to it.\n\nRather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button. Rather than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction, use Reply as a Linked Topic.\n\n<a name=\"stealing\"></a>\n\n## [Post Only Your Own Stuff](#stealing)\n\nYou may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission. You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone’s intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.\n\n<a name=\"power\"></a>\n\n## [Powered by You](#power)\n\nThis site is operated by your [friendly local staff](/about) and *you*, the community.
